## english-paper


This is the english version of my matura paper (older german version [here](http://tiny.cc/3DPOV)). I am mainly doing this for EUCYS 2016, which I was invited for in the context of the swiss national competition by Swiss Youth in Science ("Schweizer Jugend Forscht", there's not an official english name. Literally it means "swiss youth researches").

I'm also taking the opportunity to learn a thing or two about LaTeX and vim (read: start from 0).
