## english-paper
 
This is the english version of my matura paper ([older german version](http://tiny.cc/3DPOV)). I
am mainly doing this translation for EUCYS 2016, which I was invited for in the context of the
swiss national competition by Swiss Youth in Science ("Schweizer Jugend Forscht", there's not an
official english name. The literal translation would be "Swiss Youth Researches").

I'm also taking the opportunity to learn a thing or two about LaTeX and vim (read: start both from
0).

Aside from the language, there are also slight changes in structure and content. Several things
are shorter in the english version. Additionally, I included the changes I made for the national
competition in the text itself instead of writing an extra chapter with all those modifications.
