## english-paper

This is the english version of my matura paper ([older german
version](http://tiny.cc/3DPOV)). I mainly made this translation for EUCYS
2016, which I was invited for in the context of the national competition by
Swiss Youth in Science.

This repo contains four documents:

- `paper.*`: Original, somewhat unfinished 1:1 translation of the german
  paper.
- `paper-short.*`: Shorter version I wrote when I found out that EUCYS only
  takes reports of up to 10 pages
- `summary.*`: One-page summary of the whole project
- `straightforward.*`: An even shorter description of the project, intended
  to be readable by the layman.
