## english-paper

This is the english version of my matura paper ([older german
version](http://tiny.cc/3DPOV)). I am mainly doing this translation for
EUCYS 2016, which I was invited for in the context of the swiss national
competition by Swiss Youth in Science ("Schweizer Jugend Forscht", there's
not an official english name. The literal translation would be "Swiss Youth
Researches").

This repo contains four documents:

- `paper.*`: Original, somewhat unfinished 1:1 translation of the german
  paper.
- `paper-short.*`: Shorter version I wrote when I found out that EUCYS only
  takes reports of up to 10 pages
- `summary.*`: One-page summary of the whole project
- `straightforward.*`: An even shorter description of the project, intended
  to be readable by the layman.
